    "Smart Vehicle Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates a simple AI-based vehicle classifier using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "It demonstrates **inheritance, protected and private members, method overriding, and encapsulation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The program manages two types of vehicles: **Car** and **Bike**. Each class inherits from a base class Vehicle.\n",
    "A simple classifier method predicts the type of vehicle based on its speed threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a simple program that classifies vehicles based on their type and speed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a base class Vehicle that stores vehicle type, name, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use private attributes in the base class to demonstrate encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement a method classify() that categorizes vehicles as High-speed Vehicle if the speed is greater than 100, otherwise Normal Vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Derive two subclasses — Car and Bike — from Vehicle. Each should override the show_info() method to display detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Read multiple inputs representing different vehicles, create corresponding objects, and print their details along with their classification results.\n",

    "Use a base class **Vehicle** with protected and private attributes.\n",
    "Create subclasses **Car** and **Bike** that override **show_info()** and add a simple speed-based classifier.\n",
    "Speed above 100 is considered a \"High-speed Vehicle\".\n",
