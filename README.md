Daily progress, notes, and practice from Phitronâ€™s Machine Learning &amp; AI course.
Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This repo is where I share my daily progress as I go through the Machine Learning & AI course by Phitron.
Iâ€™ll be updating it regularly with my notes, practice codes, and small projects.

I created this repo not only to track my learning, but also to look back later and see how far Iâ€™ve come.

Future Goals:
- Build cool projects as I move forward
- Dive into Deep Learning and Neural Networks
- Experiment with real-world datasets
- Keep improving, one day at a time
